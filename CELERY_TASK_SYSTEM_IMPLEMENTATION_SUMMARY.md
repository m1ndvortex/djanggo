### 3. Docker Integration

**Services Configuration:**
```yaml
celery:
  build: .
  command: celery -A zargar worker -l info
  environment:
    - CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
    - CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://redis:6379/0

celery-beat:
  build: .
  command: celery -A zargar beat -l info
```

**Health Checks:**
- Celery worker health monitoring
- Redis connectivity verification
- Task execution monitoring

### 4. Task Discovery and Registration

**Verified Task Registration:**
```
✓ zargar.gold_installments.tasks.update_gold_prices
✓ zargar.admin_panel.tasks.start_backup_job
✓ zargar.admin_panel.tasks.cleanup_old_backups
✓ zargar.core.notification_services.process_scheduled_notifications
✓ 29 total tasks registered and discoverable
```

### 5. Error Handling and Monitoring

**Retry Mechanisms:**
- **Gold price tasks**: 3 retries with 60-second intervals
- **Backup tasks**: 3 retries with 5-minute intervals
- **Notification tasks**: 5 retries with exponential backoff

**Health Monitoring:**
- Success rate tracking for all task categories
- API health monitoring for external services
- Comprehensive logging with structured metrics
- Alert system for critical failures

**Logging Integration:**
```python
# Health metrics logging
logger.info(f"HEALTH_METRIC: gold_price_update success_rate={success_rate:.1f}% "
           f"successful={successful_updates} failed={failed_updates}")
```
