# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical issue of duplicate admin systems in the ZARGAR jewelry SaaS platform. Currently, there are multiple admin interfaces and authentication flows that create confusion, security risks, and maintenance overhead. The goal is to consolidate all admin functionality into a single, unified super admin system while preserving the existing tenant login system and maintaining perfect tenant isolation.
