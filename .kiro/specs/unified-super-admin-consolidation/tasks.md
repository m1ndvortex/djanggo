    - Add comprehensive audit logging for all admin authentication and actions
    - Remove duplicate authentication backends and login pages safely
    - Write comprehensive security tests for unified authentication system
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 4. Legacy System Cleanup and URL Consolidation
  - [ ] 4.1 Remove duplicate admin interfaces and consolidate routing

    - Clean up duplicate admin URLs and view functions
    - Remove obsolete authentication backends and middleware
    - Update all internal references to point to unified admin system
    - Preserve tenant login system completely unchanged (auth/tenant_login.html)

    - Migrate existing SuperAdmin data and audit logs to unified system
    - Transfer existing session data and system settings
    - Verify all existing admin functionality works in unified interface
    - Clean up obsolete database tables and unused migrations
    - Validate data integrity and system performance after migration
    - Write comprehensive tests to verify successful data migration
    - _Requirements: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5_

- [ ] 6. Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance
  - [ ] 6.1 Implement comprehensive testing suite for unified admin system
