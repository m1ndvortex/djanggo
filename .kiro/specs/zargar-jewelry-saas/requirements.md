# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ZARGAR is a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly multi-tenant SaaS platform designed specifically for Iranian gold and jewelry businesses. The platform provides a Persian-native, RTL-first experience with complete light and dark mode support, built on Django with Django REST Framework (DRF) as a unified full-stack solution. The system uses Django Templates with server-side rendering (no separate frontend framework), Django's built-in authentication system, django-tenants for multi-tenancy, and integrates UI/UX with Tailwind CSS, Flowbite, Alpine.js, and HTMX. The system serves two primary user groups: platform administrators through a Super-Panel and jewelry shop owners/employees through individual tenant portals.
