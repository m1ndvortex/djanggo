## 🚀 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Deploy Security Updates (HIGH PRIORITY)
```bash
# 1. Backup current environment
docker-compose exec web pip freeze > requirements_backup.txt

# 2. Rebuild with updated dependencies
docker-compose build --no-cache

# 3. Run comprehensive tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm web pytest

# 4. Deploy to staging first
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d

# 5. Run security audit
python scripts/security_audit.py
```

### 2. GitHub Security Configuration
```bash
# Enable Dependabot alerts
# Go to: Settings → Security & analysis → Dependabot alerts (Enable)

# Enable secret scanning
# Go to: Settings → Security & analysis → Secret scanning (Enable)

# Enable code scanning
# Go to: Settings → Security & analysis → Code scanning (Enable)
```

### 3. Production Environment Hardening
- [ ] Enable database SSL connections
- [ ] Configure WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection
- [ ] Enable log monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure backup encryption
