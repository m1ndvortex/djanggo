ZARGAR SaaS Testing Strategy & Implementation Guide

## Overview
Comprehensive testing framework for the ZARGAR jewelry business SaaS platform, ensuring reliability, security, and performance at all levels.

## Testing Philosophy
Multi-layered testing approach covering unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance testing, and automated testing pipelines to guarantee a robust, secure, and performant platform for Iranian jewelry businesses.

## 1. Unit Testing

Framework: pytest with Django test suite integration.

Coverage Requirements: Minimum 90% code coverage for all business logic and API endpoints.

Test Categories: Model validation, business logic functions, utility functions, and data transformation.

Automated Execution: All unit tests run on every code commit via CI/CD pipeline.

Mock Strategy: Comprehensive mocking for external services (gold price APIs, payment gateways).

Django-Specific Testing:
- Model tests for all jewelry business entities (products, customers, transactions)
- View tests for both Django templates and DRF API endpoints
- Form validation tests for Persian/Farsi input handling
- Custom manager and QuerySet testing for multi-tenant data isolation
- Signal testing for automated business logic triggers

Persian/RTL Testing:
- Text direction and layout testing for RTL interfaces
- Persian calendar date handling and conversion testing
- Toman currency formatting and calculation testing
- Persian number formatting validation

## 2. Integration Testing

Database Integration: Test all Django ORM operations, migrations, and database constraints.

API Integration: Full DRF endpoint testing including authentication, authorization, and data validation.

External Service Integration: Test all third-party integrations (payment processors, SMS services, email delivery).

Multi-tenant Testing: Verify data isolation and tenant-specific functionality across different schemas.

Cache Integration: Redis caching layer testing for data consistency and performance.

Django-Tenants Testing:
- Schema isolation verification between different jewelry shops
- Tenant creation and deletion testing
- Cross-tenant data leakage prevention testing
- Subdomain routing and tenant resolution testing

Authentication & Security Testing:
- Django built-in authentication system testing
- DRF token authentication and JWT testing
- Multi-factor authentication (2FA) integration testing
- Permission and role-based access control testing
- Session management and security testing

Business Logic Integration:
- Complete jewelry sale transaction flow testing
- Inventory management workflow testing
- Persian accounting system integration testing
- Gold price API integration and calculation testing
- Invoice generation and Persian formatting testing

## 3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Stakeholder Involvement: Real jewelry shop owners testing actual business workflows.

Scenario-Based Testing: Complete business process testing (inventory management, sales, accounting).

Performance UAT: Real-world load testing with actual business data volumes.

Security UAT: Penetration testing and security validation by external security firms.

Mobile API Testing: Comprehensive testing of DRF endpoints for future mobile app integration.

Business Workflow Testing:
- Complete customer purchase journey from inquiry to sale completion
- Inventory management from receiving goods to sale tracking
- Persian accounting workflows including journal entries and reporting
- Multi-user scenarios with different roles (owner, accountant, salesperson)
- Daily business operations simulation with realistic data volumes

Localization UAT:
- Persian language interface testing by native speakers
- Persian calendar functionality validation in business context
- Toman currency handling in real business scenarios
- RTL layout usability testing across different screen sizes
- Cultural appropriateness validation for Iranian business practices

## 4. Automated Testing Pipeline

Continuous Testing: All tests automatically executed on code commits and pull requests.

Test Environment Management: Separate testing databases and isolated test environments.

Test Data Management: Automated test data generation and cleanup procedures.

Regression Testing: Automated detection of breaking changes in existing functionality.

Performance Regression: Automated performance testing to detect speed degradations.

CI/CD Integration:
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated test execution
- Docker containerized testing environments
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback cycles
- Test result reporting and failure notifications
- Automated deployment blocking on test failures

Test Data Strategies:
- Factory-based test data generation using factory_boy
- Realistic Persian business data generation (names, addresses, products)
- Multi-tenant test data isolation and cleanup
- Performance test data sets with varying scales
- Anonymized production data for realistic testing scenarios

## 5. Performance Testing

Load Testing:
- Concurrent user simulation (1,000+ users across multiple tenants)
- Database performance under realistic business operation loads
- API endpoint performance testing with mobile app simulation
- Redis caching effectiveness validation
- Multi-tenant performance isolation testing

Stress Testing:
- System behavior under peak jewelry shopping seasons
- Database connection pool exhaustion scenarios
- Memory and CPU resource limit testing
- Network latency and timeout handling
- Graceful degradation testing under system stress

## 6. Security Testing

Penetration Testing:
- External security firm validation quarterly
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- Multi-tenant security boundary testing
- API security validation for mobile app endpoints
- Data encryption verification (at rest and in transit)

Compliance Testing:
- GDPR compliance validation for customer data handling
- Iranian business regulation compliance testing
